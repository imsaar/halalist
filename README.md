## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click "Take or Upload Photo" to capture an ingredient label
3. Click "‚úÇÔ∏è Select Area" to crop to just the ingredients section
4. Draw a rectangle around the ingredients text
5. Click "Scan Selected Area" to detect ingredients
6. Review the results - suspicious ingredients appear in yellow, prohibited in red
7. If results aren't clear, use "Try Different Processing" to cycle through enhancement modes

## How It Works

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload** - User uploads or captures a photo of ingredients
2. **Crop** - User selects the specific area containing ingredients text
3. **Preprocess** - Image is enhanced for better OCR (contrast, sharpening, etc.)
4. **OCR** - Tesseract.js extracts text from the processed image
5. **Detection** - Extracted text is compared against ingredient lists
6. **Display** - Matching ingredients are highlighted with appropriate warnings

### Processing Modes
- **Mild Enhancement** - Gentle contrast boost and grayscale (default)
- **Sharpen Filter** - Helps with blurry text
- **Adaptive Threshold** - Better for low contrast text
- **High Resolution Original** - Minimal processing, just upscaling
